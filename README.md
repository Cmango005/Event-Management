Here are five features of the `Home` component:

1. **Buy Now Button with Link**: The component includes a "Buy Now" button that is wrapped with a `Link` component from React Router. This allows users to navigate to the "/latest" route when they click the button.

2. **Marquee for Latest iPhone 15**: The component uses the "react-fast-marquee" library to display a scrolling marquee that announces the release of the latest iPhone 15. It adds a dynamic and eye-catching element to the page.

3. **Clickable Service Card**: There is a clickable service card with a pink background that invites users to click and see the latest gadgets. It provides an interactive way for users to explore products.

4. **Clickable Review Card**: Another card in the component is designed for showcasing customer reviews. Users can click on it to access reviews from happy customers, creating a sense of trust and credibility.

5. **Facebook Link**: The component includes a section with a "Find Us on Facebook" message, and it is wrapped with a `Link` component pointing to the Apple Facebook page. Clicking on it will take users to the Apple Facebook page.

These features enhance the user experience and encourage user engagement by providing easy navigation, dynamic content, and links to relevant information and resources.
