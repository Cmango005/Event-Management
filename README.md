Here are five features of the `Home` component:

1. **Dynamic Event Display**: The `Home` component dynamically displays upcoming events fetched from the `events` data source. It maps through the events and generates cards with event details, including the event name, location, date, and a "Details" button that links to a separate details page.

2. **Scroll Animation**: The component incorporates smooth scroll animations using the "AOS" (Animate on Scroll) library to create a visually appealing user experience. This library animates elements as they come into the viewport, enhancing the page's aesthetics.

3. **Marquee Announcement**: It includes a marquee element at the top of the page to display important announcements or messages. In this case, it invites users to click on event details and join upcoming events.

4. **Complaint Form**: The component provides a form at the bottom, allowing users to submit complaints. Users can enter their name, email, phone number, and details of their complaint, and then submit the complaint.

5. **Responsive Layout**: The component is designed to be responsive, ensuring that the content and layout adapt to different screen sizes. This responsiveness is important for providing a consistent user experience across various devices.

These features combine to create a dynamic and engaging landing page for an event management website, where users can explore upcoming events, receive announcements, and submit complaints easily.
